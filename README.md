# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application in projects 10-11. It utilizes Express.js, MongoDB, Node.js, and Mongoose. The server is run through MongoDB and uses Postman to create the user requests. It has signup and signin functionality, along with user authorization to determine the user's ability to see their profile and only delete their items from the server.
